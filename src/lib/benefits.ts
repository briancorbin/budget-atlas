// ── Medicaid ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Medicaid eligibility. Two regimes:
 *
 * 1. Expansion states (40 + DC): all adults up to 138% FPL, regardless of
 *    parental status.
 * 2. Non-expansion states (10): parents qualify only up to a much lower
 *    state-specific threshold (e.g. 17% FPL in Texas, ~95% in Tennessee).
 *    Childless adults have NO Medicaid pathway at any income — the
 *    "coverage gap." This is the editorial highlight worth surfacing.
 *
 * Children's Medicaid is broader; we route kids through CHIP as the
 * separate program, which subsumes Medicaid-for-kids in this model.
 *
 * ── How we compute the dollar VALUE of Medicaid ──
 * `monthlyBenefit = monthlyHealthcareCost`, where `monthlyHealthcareCost`
 * is the household's `cityData.healthFamily` (or healthSingle) figure
 * sourced from KFF's Employer Health Benefits Survey — the worker's share
 * of an employer-sponsored family premium. The model treats Medicaid as
 * worth exactly what employer-sponsored coverage would cost the worker,
 * which is a simplification with two real-world limitations:
 *
 *  (a) Medicaid is genuinely better than typical employer coverage —
 *      $0 deductible, $0 copays, often broader dental/vision for kids —
 *      so its actuarial value is higher than what a worker would pay
 *      for an equivalent private plan.
 *  (b) Conversely, a household losing Medicaid often lands on an ACA
 *      marketplace plan that costs MORE than the modeled employer
 *      premium (different premium, plus deductibles + out-of-pocket
 *      max). So the post-cliff expense undercounts real-world cost.
 *
 * The symmetry — Medicaid value == post-cliff healthcare expense —
 * means cliff drops on the Discretionary line equal cliff drops on the
 * Take-home + benefits line. A more honest model would split these.
 * See roadmap: "Asymmetric Medicaid value vs. post-cliff cost".

/**
 * CHIP eligibility. Per-state income limit (typically 200%–400% FPL).
 * Only relevant when there are children in the household.
 *
 * ── How we compute the dollar VALUE of CHIP ──
 * Same KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey lineage as Medicaid: the
 * `monthlyHealthcareCost` and `monthlyHealthcareSingle` are from
 * `cityData.healthFamily` and `cityData.healthSingle` respectively.
 * CHIP value is the kids' marginal share of the family premium — the
 * cost of adding children to an adult-only plan:
 *
 *   1 adult + kids   →  family premium − single-coverage premium
 *   2 adults + kids  →  family premium − (2 × single-coverage premium)
 *                       (we don't model an explicit two-adult plan rate;
 *                        2× single is a reasonable approximation)
 *
 * Real CHIP often charges small premiums above ~150% FPL (varies by state);
 * we treat coverage as fully replacing the kids' share for simplicity.
 *
 * Same caveat as Medicaid: by treating CHIP value as exactly the kids'
 * employer-premium share, we assume the post-CHIP-cliff household pays
 * exactly that amount to add kids to a private plan. The true value of
 * CHIP coverage (low/no copays, broad pediatric coverage) is likely
 * higher; the true post-cliff cost depends on whether the household
 * has employer coverage available or has to use the marketplace. See
 * roadmap: "Asymmetric Medicaid value vs. post-cliff cost".
